Chess Game Development Guidelines using React + Vite + TypeScript
Core Architecture Considerations

State Management

Use Redux or Context API to maintain the game state
Track board position, piece locations, turn information, move history, and game status
Create immutable state updates for reliable history tracking and undo functionality

Component Hierarchy

Board component (container for the entire chess interface)
Square components (individual board positions)
Piece components (visual representations with appropriate behaviors)
Control panel (game controls, move history, captured pieces)
Game information display (current player, check status, timer)

Chess Logic Implementation

Separate game logic from UI components
Implement chess rules as pure functions that operate on game state
Consider using an established chess library like chess.js for core game logic


Difficulty Levels Design

Implement multiple AI algorithms with varying depths of move calculation
Consider limiting the AI's "vision" of future moves based on difficulty
Add randomization factors to lower difficulties to create more human-like play
Implement opening book knowledge proportional to difficulty level



Technical Implementation

Project Setup

Initialize with npm create vite@latest chess-game -- --template react-ts
Configure TypeScript for strict type checking
Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality


UI Framework Selection

Consider MUI (Material-UI) for structured components and theming
Alternative: Chakra UI for accessibility-focused design
TailwindCSS for utility-first styling approach
Styled Components for component-specific styling


Chess Board Implementation

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for board layout
Implement drag-and-drop with react-dnd
Ensure mobile responsiveness with adaptive sizing
Match the color scheme from the provided image (light/dark green squares)


Game Engine

Model the board as an 8×8 matrix
Define piece movement patterns and validation rules
Implement special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
Check and checkmate detection algorithms


AI Implementation

Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency
Evaluation function weighing material, position, king safety, etc.
Implement different search depths based on difficulty level
Consider opening book implementation for early game moves



Feature Implementation

Two-Player Mode

Local two-player functionality
Optional: Implement online multiplayer using WebSockets or Firebase
Turn management and validation


Single-Player with AI

Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert)
AI thinking indicators during computer turns
Customizable AI behavior (aggressive, defensive, balanced)


Game Controls

New game functionality with selectable sides/colors
Undo/redo move capability
Save/load game functionality using localStorage or database
Game timer options (bullet, blitz, rapid, classical)


Enhanced UI Features

Move highlighting (possible moves, last move made)
Move sound effects
Optional move notation display (algebraic notation)
Captured pieces display area
Game status messages


Accessibility Considerations

Keyboard navigation support
Screen reader compatibility
Color contrast options
Text-based move input alternative
